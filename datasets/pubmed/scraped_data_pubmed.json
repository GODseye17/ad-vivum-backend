Microscopically, it consists of \na biphasic population of small neuroblast-like cells and larger \nmelanin-containing epithelioid cells. The main purpose of this study is to \ncharacterize clinicopathological and immunohistochemical features of MNTI at a \nsingle institution and discuss challenges in the differential diagnosis.\nMETHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of MNTI cases diagnosed at our \ncenter during a 10-year period and discussed the differential diagnoses.\nRESULTS: Eleven MNTI cases were identified. Median patient age was 5 months. \nMale to Female ratio was 1.75:1. Tumor distribution was in the Maxilla (n\u2009=\u20098), \nMandible (n\u2009=\u20091) greater wing of Sphenoid (n\u2009=\u20091), and Temporal bone (n\u2009=\u20091). \nAll tumors revealed classic biphasic morphology in the resection specimens. By \nimmunohistochemistry, 9/9 (100%) cases were positive for both AE1/AE3 and HMB45 \nin the larger epithelioid cells and 6/6 (100%) were positive for Synaptophysin \nin the smaller neuroblast-like cells. One patient had unique nested areas \ncomposed of mature glial tissue. One patient who had incomplete resection was \ngiven adjuvant radiotherapy. One patient developed a solitary ipsilateral lymph \nnodal metastasis. Follow-up period ranged from 1 to 93 months. All the patients \nwere alive with no evidence of disease at the last follow-up (median: 16 \nmonths).\nCONCLUSIONS: Lack of consideration of MNTI in the differential diagnosis can \nlead to misdiagnosis and undue exposure to cytotoxic therapies. Awareness of the \nclassic biphasic morphology and distinct immunoprofile of MNTI is essential.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

There is a lack of robust data comparing laparoscopic and robotic \npancreatic surgery for PNETs and this has led to the lack of a global conclusion \nregarding which approach is superior. Thus, we conducted a systematic review and \nmeta-analysis of the available data to compare outcomes following laparoscopic \nversus robotic pancreatic surgery for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.\nMETHODS: Studies reporting outcomes of laparoscopic or robotic surgery for \npancreatic neuroendocrine tumors were included. Inverse variance and \nMantel-Haenszel statistical analysis methods were used for continuous and \ndichotomous data, respectively. All outcomes were quantitatively analyzed using \nthe random effects model. The risk of bias was assessed using the ROBINS-1 tool.\nRESULTS: A total of 14 studies with 767 patients were included. The mean \ndifference in the operating time was 21.08\u00a0min (95% CI: -4.38, 46.54, I2\u2009=\u200943%), \nfavouring the laparoscopic group. The pooled odds ratio for the rate of \nformation of the pancreatic fistula was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.54, 1.45, I2\u2009=\u20090%), \nfavouring the robotic group. Blood loss was higher in the laparoscopic group (MD \n= -89.72\u00a0ml, 95% CI:-143.37 to -36.06, I2\u2009=\u200993%). Other parameters, including \nre-exploration rate, length of hospital stay, R0 resection, rate of conversion, \nand spleen preservation, were similar in both groups.\nCONCLUSION: The robotic approach might be preferable to the laparoscopic \napproach because of the lower rate of POPF and blood loss. Larger randomised \ncontrolled trials are required to ascertain these findings.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

We used the COST-FACIT and CFPB Financial Well-Being Scales to assess \nfinancial toxicity. QoL was assessed with the European Organization for Research \nand Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ C30 questionnaire, and distress with the \nNCCN distress thermometer.\nRESULTS: Between June 2022 and September 2023, we enrolled 953 patients. The \nmedian age was 66 (IQR 63-72) years; 277 patients (29.1%) were over 70\u00a0years \nold, 737 (77.3%) were male, and 135 (14.2%) had health insurance. Therapy was \nplanned with palliative intent in 607 (63.7%) patients. The prevalence of \nfinancial toxicity was 73.7% as per the COST-FACIT scale (n\u2009=\u2009703), and 66% as \nper the CFPB (n\u2009=\u2009629). Higher financial toxicity on the COST-FACIT scale was \nassociated with poor financial well-being on the CFPB scale. Financial toxicity \nwas associated with poor QoL and higher distress. Factors associated with \nsignificantly greater financial toxicity included history of tobacco chewing, \nmonthly family income less than \u20b950,000, lack of health insurance, illiteracy, \ndepression, and cognitive impairment.\nCONCLUSIONS: Identifying the factors contributing to financial toxicity will \nhelp make the cancer treatment journey smoother, more accessible and improve \ncompliance to therapy for older patients.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: CTRI/2020/04/024675.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted \nat the Department of Biochemistry of Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India, over \na period of five months. Blood samples of patients received in sodium fluoride \nand EDTA tubes at the same time for estimation of blood glucose and HbA1c \nrespectively were included in the study. HbA1c results by HPLC method on Bio-Rad \nD10 analyzer were compared with turbidimetric immunoinhibition method on Beckman \nCoulter AU 5800 analyzer. Data was analyzed using statistical software SPSS \nversion 29. Results Blood samples of 384 patients, of which 193 (50.3%) were \nfemale and 191 (49.7%) were male with an average age of 55.2 \u00b1 12.4 years were \nincluded in the study. The majority of these samples were from 78 (20.3%), 77 \n(20.1%) and 60 (15.6%) patients with urological cancers, breast cancer and \ngastrointestinal cancers, respectively. There was no significant difference in \nthe average HbA1c value estimated from EDTA and sodium fluoride tube by HPLC \n(6.71\u00b11.7 and 6.71\u00b11.7, respectively) and turbidimetric immunoinhibition \n(6.74\u00b11.6 and 6.72\u00b11.7, respectively) method. A strong and significant \ncorrelation was observed in HbA1c values estimated from either tube by both \nmethods (p-value <0.0001). Conclusion Our study confirms that HbA1c can be \nconveniently estimated from a sodium fluoride tube, thereby eliminating the \nnecessity of an EDTA tube for the same and it also observes that HbA1c results \nby HPLC and turbidimetric immunoinhibition method are comparable and thus can be \nanalyzed by either of the methods interchangeably.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025, Raut et al.\n\nDOI: 10.7759/cureus.81164\nPMCID: PMC12020781\nPMID: 40276456\n\nConflict of interest statement: Human subjects: Consent for treatment and open \naccess publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study. \nInstitutional Ethics Committee-II issued approval 4229.

Community \nHealth Workers (CHWs), such as Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs), \nVillage Health Nurses (VHNs), and Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs), play a \ncritical role in bridging these healthcare gaps. This study explores the \nbarriers and contributions of CHWs while facilitating early detection and \nsubsequent care in selected rural areas of India.\nMETHODS: This qualitative study is part of the Access Cancer Care India (ACCI) \nimplementation research project, conducted in three states: Rajasthan, Kerala, \nand Tamil Nadu. We conducted six focus group discussions (FGDs) with 47 CHWs, \nrepresenting various health cadres, to investigate their experiences and the \nbarriers they face in delivering cervical, breast and oral cancer care. The \ndiscussions were analyzed using Charmaz's Grounded Theory approach, with axial \ncoding and constant comparative analysis until data saturation was reached.\nRESULTS: CHWs identified multiple barriers to cancer early detection and \nsubsequent care delivery, organized into six overarching themes: (1) Program \nfocus and awareness, (2) Treatment and referral challenges, (3) Acceptability \nand accessibility, (4) Rigid social customs and beliefs, (5) Lack of support at \nhigher centers, and (6) Financial constraints. A lack of formal training, poor \ninfrastructure, negative communication, fear of diagnosis, and financial burdens \nwere among the major barriers highlighted. CHWs from Tamil Nadu and Kerala, \nwhere sporadic screening initiatives exist, reported better preparedness \ncompared to their counterparts in Rajasthan. Additionally, the CHWs outlined the \nvital role of positive word-of-mouth and community engagement in improving \ncancer screening participation.\nCONCLUSIONS: CHWs in rural India face significant personal, community, and \nhealth system barriers while facilitating cancer early detection services and \nsubsequent follow up. Addressing these barriers through tailored training, \nenhanced health infrastructure, and community-based interventions can improve \ncancer care access and outcomes in rural settings. Future policies should focus \non strengthening CHW-led approaches and addressing the systemic barriers in \ncancer care delivery.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

We developed a novel humanized CD19-directed CAR-T \n(HCAR19) approved for Phase 1/1b/2 trials. Patients aged 3-25 years were \nenrolled with r/r B-ALL and ineligible for allogeneic stem cell transplant. \nLymphodepletion utilized standard-dose fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. A 3\u2009+\u20093 \ndesign testing 3 dose-ranges was used to determine Phase-2 Dose (P2D): Dose-A, \n1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 HCAR19 cells/kg, Dose-B, 3-5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106/kg, and Dose-C, 10-15\u2009\u00d7\u2009106/kg. \nPrimary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) at day-30 on bone-marrow \nflow-cytometry. From May-2021 to September-2023 12 patients [median age-14 \n(range: 5-24) years] were enrolled with median bone marrow blasts 19.5% at \nscreening. Cytokine release syndrome occurred in 10 (83%) patients, \npredominantly Grades 1-2, and Grade-2 immune-cell associated neurotoxicity \n(ICANS) in 1. All patients had Grade-3 cytopenia. ORR was 91.7% (11/12), \ncomplete response (CR) in 8 (66.7%) and partial response in 3 (25%). Seven of 8 \nCRs were at Dose-levels B and C, all of which were sustained till 12 months \nfollow-up. Patients who received dose levels below 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009106/kg, or did not \nachieve CR, had early loss of response or rapid progression. HCAR19 demonstrated \nsafety, manageable toxicity, and durable remissions. and P2D was determined as \n5-10\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 HCAR19-cells/kg.

This study \ninvestigates safety, toxicology, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of CHL as an \nadjunct to breast cancer chemotherapy. Acute and sub-acute oral toxicity of CHL \nwas assessed in mice and rats under Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) conditions \nfollowing OECD guidelines. Anti-cancer effects and mechanisms were evaluated in \n4\u2009T1mouse\u00a0breast cancer cells using viability assays, colony formation analysis, \nand proteomics. Cyclophosphamide (CYP)-induced painful bladder syndrome (PBS) \nwas studied in C57BL/6 female\u00a0mice. In acute toxicity study, up to 5000 mg/kg bw \nof CHL was well tolerated without any signs of toxicity and death. In the \nsub-acute toxicity study, no features suggestive of drug-induced toxicity \nindicated No-Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) to be beyond 1000 mg/kg bw. \nCHL showed wide biodistribution, achieving sustained therapeutic concentrations \nin target tissues. CHL enhanced the anti-proliferative and cytotoxic effects of \nCYP in 4\u2009T1 breast cancer cells, and proteomics studies revealed disruption in \nDNA damage repair, microtubule dynamics, and mitochondrial biogenesis, leading \nto apoptosis. CHL (100 mg/kg bw, oral) showed significant therapeutic benefit \nfor treatment of CYP induced PBS. CHL alleviated PBS symptoms by restoring IL- \n22 levels, reducing oxidative stress, and improving bladder functionality. \nChlorophyllin appears to be relatively safe even at high doses, demonstrates \npotentially favorable pharmacology, and may hold promise for mitigating \nCYP-induced bladder toxicity and enhancing chemotherapy efficacy.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Homeopathy, with its \nholistic and individualized approach, considers a vast array of symptoms and \npatient aspects. The present study debates the merits of integrating the \ndetailed emotional analyses of GNM into the wide-ranging, symptom-based approach \nof homeopathy. Integration efforts are aimed at augmenting the depth of patient \nassessments, especially concerning the emotional etiology of diseases. The study \nindicated that while GNM can provide valuable insights, it should supplement \nrather than overshadow the comprehensive methodologies of homeopathic treatment. \nFuture research avenues are proposed to evaluate the impact of combined GNM and \nhomeopathic practices on patient outcomes, particularly in the domain of cancer, \nto uphold and possibly enhance the tradition of holistic and personalized \npatient care.\n\n\u00a9 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\n\nDOI: 10.1002/jat.4796\nPMID: 40273922",
