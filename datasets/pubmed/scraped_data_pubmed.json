The study was based on deidentified \npatient portal message data from individuals with breast or skin cancer at \nStanford Health Care and 22 affiliated centers over July 2013 to April 2024.\nEXPOSURES: A widely used large language model (ChatGPT-4o [OpenAI]; April 2024) \nwas used and guided through multiple prompt-engineering strategies to perform \nmultilevel tasks, including knowledge interpretation and summarization (eg, \ninterpreting and summarizing the NLP-defined topics), knowledge generation (eg, \ngenerating research ideas corresponding to patients' issues), self-reflection \nand correction (eg, ensuring and revising the research ideas after searching for \nscientific articles), and self-reassurance (eg, confirming and finalizing the \nresearch ideas).\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Three breast oncologists (J.L.C., A.W.K., F.R) and 3 \ndermatologists (K.Y.S, J.Y.T., E.L.) evaluated the meaningfulness and novelty of \nthe AI-generated research topics using a 5-point Likert scale (1 representing \nexceptional to 5 representing poor). Mean (SD) scores for meaningfulness and \nnovelty were computed for each topic.\nRESULTS: A total of 614\u202f464 patient messages were analyzed from 25\u202f549 \nindividuals, 10\u202f665 with breast cancer (98.6% female) and 14\u202f884 had skin cancer \n(49.0% female). The overall mean (SD) scores for meaningfulness and novelty were \n3.00 (0.50) and 3.29 (0.74), respectively, for breast cancer topics and 2.67 \n(0.45) and 3.09 (0.68), respectively, for skin cancer topics. One-third of the \nAI-suggested research topics were highly meaningful and novel when both scores \nwere lower than the average (5 of 15 for breast cancer and 6 of 15 for skin \ncancer). Notably, two-thirds of the AI-suggested topics were novel (10 of 15 for \nbreast cancer and 11 of 15 for skin cancer).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This case series demonstrates that AI/NLP-driven \nanalysis of large volumes of patient messages can generate quality research \ntopics in cancer care that reflect patient perspectives, providing valuable \nguidance for future patient-centered health research endeavors.\n\nDOI: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2025.0694\nPMID: 40272833",

Results from the single-arm KEYNOTE-B10 \n(NCT04489888) showed promising antitumor activity and a manageable safety \nprofile offering an alternative pembrolizumab and chemotherapy regimen (KN-B10), \nwith paclitaxel replacing 5-FU. With KEYNOTE-B10 being a non-comparative trial, \nthis study aims to estimate the comparative efficacy of KN-B10 versus \nalternative first-line systemic treatments for R/M HNSCC via an indirect \ntreatment comparison analysis.\nMETHODS: A systematic literature review (October 2023) identified six connected \nrandomized controlled trials with similar eligibility criteria to KEYNOTE-B10. \nInterventions included cetuximab\u2009+\u2009platinum\u2009+\u20095-FU (EXTREME), \ncetuximab\u2009+\u2009cisplatin\u2009+\u2009docetaxel (TPEx), pembrolizumab\u2009+\u2009platinum\u2009+\u20095-FU \n(KN-048), platinum\u2009+\u20095-FU, cisplatin\u2009+\u2009paclitaxel, cisplatin, 5-FU, and \nmethotrexate. To connect KEYNOTE-B10 to the network, individual patient-level \ndata were weighted to match the population characteristics of the most similar \ntrial in the network (KEYNOTE-048). The comparative efficacy of KN-B10 versus \nother interventions was estimated via fixed-effect Bayesian network \nmeta-analyses. Due to violations of the proportional-hazards assumption, \nfractional polynomials were used to model overall survival (OS) and \nprogression-free survival (PFS).\nRESULTS: For objective response, KN-B10 was comparable to EXTREME and TPEx and \nmore efficacious than all other identified treatments (range of odds ratios \n[ORs]: 1.69-11.75), including KN-048 (OR: 1.69; 95% credible interval: \n1.01-2.81). For OS and PFS, KN-B10 was comparable to EXTREME (with improvements \nin OS after month 12), TPEx, and KN-048. KN-B10 improved OS versus \nplatinum\u2009+\u20095-FU (range of time-varying hazard ratios: 0.60-0.18; months 9-60), \ncisplatin\u2009+\u2009paclitaxel (0.53-0.24; 9-36), cisplatin (0.59-0.32; 6-24), 5-FU \n(0.58-0.20; 6-36), and methotrexate (0.61-0.07; 6-60). KN-B10 improved PFS \nversus platinum\u2009+\u20095-FU (0.60-0.31; 3-36).\nCONCLUSION: The improved\u00a0or comparable efficacy of KN-B10 versus alternative \nfirst-line interventions in terms of relevant clinical outcomes, as shown in \nthis study, supports its recommendations for the treatment of R/M HNSCC.\n\nPlain Language Summary: This study looked at how well a treatment combination \nworks for patients with a specific type of cancer called recurrent or metastatic \nhead and neck squamous cell carcinoma, which is a cancer that comes back or \nspreads to other parts of the body. The standard treatment for this type of \ncancer is a drug called pembrolizumab, which is sometimes given with \nchemotherapy\u00a0of platinum and fluorouracil\u00a0(this combination is called KN-048). A \nclinical trial called KEYNOTE-B10 found that a similar drug combination (which \nincluded pembrolizumab, carboplatin, and paclitaxel), called KN-B10, was also \neffective and safe. However, the KEYNOTE-B10 trial did not compare this \ntreatment directly to other treatments\u00a0used for the same disease, such as \nKN-048, EXTREME, and TPEx. To fill this gap, this study compared the \neffectiveness of KN-B10 with other standard treatments. To do this, researchers \nreviewed data from six similar studies that tested different treatments that \nincluded combinations with drugs like cetuximab, cisplatin, and 5-FU, among \nothers. Researchers used a method that allows them to indirectly compare results \nfrom different trials. They adjusted the data to make the KEYNOTE-B10 trial more \nsimilar to one of the other studies, called KEYNOTE-048, to ensure a fair \ncomparison. The findings showed that treatment with KN-B10 was at least as \neffective as KN-048, EXTREME, and TPEx. It also provided better survival \noutcomes compared to some other treatments, such as platinum\u2009+\u20095-FU and \ncisplatin\u2009+\u2009paclitaxel. Overall, this study suggests that KN-B10 is a strong \noption for first-line treatment of this type of cancer.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Whether this risk persists for patients \nundergoing breast-conserving surgery (BCS) with oncoplastic approaches remains \nunclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess positive \nmargins following oncoplastic BCS by histologic subtype and evaluate the impact \nof oncoplastic surgery on positive margins in ILC.\nMETHODS: We systematically searched the literature for articles reporting \npositive margin rates after oncoplastic BCS in ILC patients. Relative risks (RR) \nwere log transformed and displayed with forest plots.\nRESULTS: Eight studies, encompassing 754 ILC patients undergoing BCS (338 with \noncoplastic surgery),\u00a0were included. The pooled positive margin rate for ILC \npatients undergoing oncoplastic surgery was 31% (95% confidence interval [CI] \n21-40%). Patients with ILC had a significantly higher RR for positive margins \nafter oncoplastic BCS compared with IDC (RR 3.4, 95% CI 1.5-7.4). However, for \nILC patients with larger tumors, oncoplastic BCS was associated with a \nsignificantly lower RR for positive margins compared with standard BCS (RR 0.5, \n95% CI 0.3-0.9).\nCONCLUSIONS: Invasive lobular carcinoma patients undergoing oncoplastic BCS have \nhigher positive margin risks than IDC patients, underscoring the need for \nimproved preoperative imaging and systemic therapies. However, the addition of \noncoplastic surgery to BCS reduces positive margin rates compared with standard \nBCS in ILC patients, particularly for larger tumors. These findings highlight \nthe role of oncoplastic surgery as an important technique to optimize outcomes \nfor those at high risk of positive margins.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

SCO-101 is an oral compound that may counteract \nchemo-resistance by interacting with SRPK1, ABCG2 drug transporter, and liver \nenzyme UGT1A1. We first conducted preclinical experiments in \npaclitaxel-resistant PDAC cells to access the tumoricidal effects of SCO-101 or \nSRPK1-inhibitor alone or in combination with paclitaxel. Second, we enrolled 22 \npatients with non-resectable PDAC in a phase Ib trial to investigate safety and \npharmaco-kinetics, and to establish maximum tolerated dose (MTD) by evaluation \nof dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the first cycle of 80% dose \ngemcitabine (Gem) and nab-paclitaxel (Nab) together with increasing doses of \nSCO-101. In paclitaxel-resistant PDAC cells in vitro, a synergistic effect \nbetween SCO-101 and paclitaxel was demonstrated. In patients, daily doses for 6 \ndays of SCO-101 resulted in a two- to threefold drug accumulation, and drug \nexposure was dose proportional. Treatment was well tolerated. Transiently \nincreased blood bilirubin attributable to SCO-101 was observed in 12 cases (55%) \nand associated with jaundice in three patients. One and two DLTs, respectively, \nwere observed at 150 and 250mg dosing-levels of SCO-101, and the MTD was \ndetermined to be 200 mg of SCO-101 daily for 6 days on a bi-weekly schedule \ntogether with 80% dose of Gem and Nab. Median progression-free and overall \nsurvival was 3.3 and 9.5 months, respectively. In PDAC, SCO-101 can be added to \nGem and Nab with little and manageable toxicity. However, no clear added \nefficacy signal was observed of the combination. Trial registration number: \nNCT04652205 (Nov 29, 2020).\n\n\u00a9 2025.

Recent \nstudies have highlighted the late side effects of treatments of TC, especially \ncisplatin-based chemotherapy. These complications make the survivorship care \nchallenging with detrimental effects on health and prognosis of TC survivors \n(TCS). In this study, we provide a snapshot of common late side effects in TCS \nand a possible care pathway with a nurse-led specialised clinic.\nMETHODS: We invited TCS to participate in the study at one of the cancer centres \nin Ireland for a comprehensive screening using questionnaires, examination and \nblood tests. Further investigations were performed as indicated. Mortality was \nassessed through retrospective chart reviews.\nRESULTS: We recruited 78 TCS to participate in the study with a median of 129 \nmonths since diagnosis (range 60 to 304 months) and 3 who died in survivorship. \nSecond malignant neoplasms accounted for all three mortalities. Most common \nconditions after 5 years of diagnosis were hypertension (40%), dyslipidaemia \n(55.6%), hypogonadism (~\u200945%), and high BMI (52%). The majority of conditions \nwere diagnosed during screening, including two cases of coronary artery disease \nand one case of transient ischaemic attacks. TCS who received chemotherapy and \nwere aged more than 30 years at the time of diagnosis had a higher prevalence of \nthe late side effects.\nCONCLUSIONS: TC survivorship phase is marred by a range of late side effects. \nThis remains a challenge for patients and healthcare workers as ambiguity \nsurrounds the care pathways in the survivorship setting. We hope this nurse-led, \nspecialised, screening clinic might improve the care and service provision for \nTC survivors.\n\n\u00a9 2025.

The present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to \nexamine the in-hospital outcomes of CMV-related hospitalization in IBD patients.\nMETHODS: Electronic databases were systematically searched in PubMed, Web of \nScience (ISI), Scopus, Embase, and Google Scholar until February 2024. The \nquality of the included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. \nCochran's Q test and I2 statistics were applied to evaluate potential \nheterogeneity across eligible studies. The random-effects model obtained pooled \nodds ratio (OR) estimates and associated 95% confidence intervals (CI).\nRESULTS: Sixteen articles were included in the meta-analysis, encompassing 5120 \nIBD patients diagnosed with comorbid CMV infection. Our findings indicated that \ncompared to IBD patients without CMV, those with both CMV and IBD had a longer \nhospital length of stay (LOS) (8.65 days longer; 95% CI: 6.96, 10.34; P\u2009<\u20090.01), \na greater colectomy risk (OR\u2009=\u20092.26; 95% CI: 1.53, 3.34; P\u2009<\u20090.01), and higher \nin-hospital mortality (OR\u2009=\u20092.83; 95% CI: 1.92, 4.16; P\u2009<\u20090.01). However, the \ndifference in hospital charges between the two groups was not statistically \nsignificant (P\u2009=\u20090.78). Sensitivity analysis using the leave-one-out approach \nrevealed significant changes in hospital costs after excluding certain studies. \nAdditionally, subgroup analyses showed significant differences based on IBD \nsubtypes for surgery risk and LOS.\nCONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that CMV infection is associated with poorer \noutcomes in hospitalized IBD patients, highlighting the importance of early \ndetection and appropriate management of CMV infection in this population to \nimprove clinical outcomes and reduce healthcare resource utilization.\n\n\u00a9 2025.
